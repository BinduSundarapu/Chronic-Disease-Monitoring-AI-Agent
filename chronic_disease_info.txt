Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar. Common symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, and blurred vision. Management includes insulin therapy, healthy diet, and regular exercise.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is another chronic disease. Symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, or none at all. It can lead to stroke or heart failure if unmanaged. Controlling salt intake and regular medication is key.

Asthma is a respiratory condition causing difficulty in breathing due to inflammation. Triggers include dust, pollen, and cold air. Treatment involves inhalers and avoiding allergens.

To manage any chronic disease, regular monitoring, a healthy lifestyle, and medication adherence are essential.
# Chronic Disease Overview

Chronic diseases are long-lasting conditions with persistent effects that often require ongoing medical attention and lifestyle changes. Common examples include:

- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Cardiovascular Disease
- Arthritis
- Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

# 1. Diabetes

**Type 1 Diabetes** is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells.  
**Type 2 Diabetes** is caused by insulin resistance and is often linked to lifestyle factors.

### Symptoms:
- Excessive thirst
- Frequent urination
- Fatigue
- Blurred vision

### Management:
- Diet and exercise
- Blood sugar monitoring
- Medications (e.g., metformin, insulin)
- Regular HbA1c tests

# 2. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)

**Normal BP**: 120/80 mmHg  
**Stage 1 Hypertension**: 130–139/80–89 mmHg  
**Stage 2 Hypertension**: ≥140/90 mmHg

### Risk Factors:
- High salt intake
- Obesity
- Lack of physical activity
- Genetics

### Complications:
- Stroke
- Heart attack
- Kidney damage

# 3. Asthma

A chronic inflammatory lung disease that narrows the airways.

### Triggers:
- Allergens (dust, pollen)
- Cold air
- Exercise
- Stress

### Symptoms:
- Wheezing
- Shortness of breath
- Coughing

### Treatment:
- Inhalers (bronchodilators, corticosteroids)
- Avoiding triggers

# 4. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)

Encompasses coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

### Symptoms:
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Swelling in legs (heart failure)

### Risk Factors:
- High cholesterol
- Smoking
- Diabetes

### Prevention:
- Healthy diet (DASH or Mediterranean)
- Regular exercise
- Smoking cessation

# 5. Arthritis

Inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain and stiffness.

### Types:
- Osteoarthritis (degenerative)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune)

### Symptoms:
- Joint pain
- Swelling
- Limited motion

### Management:
- NSAIDs
- Physiotherapy
- Joint replacement (severe cases)

# 6. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Progressive loss of kidney function over time.

### Stages:
- Stage 1: eGFR ≥ 90
- Stage 5: eGFR < 15 (End-Stage Renal Disease)

### Causes:
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Glomerulonephritis

### Symptoms:
- Fatigue
- Swelling in legs
- Foamy urine

# 7. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

A progressive lung disease including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

### Symptoms:
- Chronic cough
- Mucus production
- Breathlessness

### Risk Factors:
- Smoking (major)
- Air pollution
- Occupational exposure

# General Prevention Strategies for Chronic Diseases:

- Avoid smoking and alcohol
- Maintain healthy weight
- Control blood pressure and glucose levels
- Exercise at least 150 minutes per week
- Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains
- Attend regular health check-ups
